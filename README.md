- OLD DESCRIPTION END -


This project is long not just a project for the university anymore. I try to make this my first ever game.
I want to make it a side-scroller/platformer with certain levels that play like flappy bird.

Right now it is not even in alpha, there will be a lot of stuff added in the future...

To run this game, download or clone this repository, open a command prompt in the directory where you saved this project,
and then run "mingw32-make".

This should work for Windows users, Linux users should just run "make" but I dont know
if this project even works on Linux/UNIX based systems.
